- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Affected modules and versions
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if available)

### üïê Response Timeline

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

When using these modules, we recommend:

#### General Security
- Always use the latest version of modules
- Review and understand the resources being created
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Enable Azure Security Center recommendations

#### Network Security
- Use private endpoints where available
- Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) appropriately
- Enable Azure Firewall or Web Application Firewall where needed
- Use private DNS zones for internal resolution

#### Identity and Access
- Use managed identities instead of service principals when possible
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Regularly rotate access keys and secrets
- Use Azure RBAC for fine-grained access control

#### Monitoring and Logging
- Enable Azure Monitor and Application Insights
- Configure diagnostic settings for all resources
- Set up security alerts and notifications
- Regularly review access logs

### üîç Security Scanning

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Static Analysis**: Checkov security scanning
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog for credential scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Dependabot for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Quality**: TFLint for Terraform best practices
